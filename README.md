Amazon CloneAmazon Clone |
The Amazon clone that I developed using HTML, CSS, and JS is a fully functional e-commerce website that mimics the look and feel of the original Amazon website. It includes a homepage with featured products, a product detail page with images and descriptions, a shopping cart, and a checkout process. The website also includes user authentication, allowing users to create accounts and log in to make purchases. The design is responsive, ensuring that the website looks and works well on all devices. Additionally, the website includes search functionality and filters to help users easily find products they are looking for. Overall, the Amazon clone is a comprehensive and visually appealing e-commerce website built using modern web technologies.
